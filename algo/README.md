# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project visualizes some of the most well-known sorting algorithms using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. It provides a real-time graphical view of how each algorithm sorts an array of randomly generated bars.

## ‚ú® Supported Sorting Algorithms

- ü´ß **Bubble Sort**
- ‚ö° **Quick Sort**
- üß© **Merge Sort**

---

## üõ† Requirements

- A C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- SFML (automatically handled by CMake)

---

## üêß Installation (Linux)

### Step 1: Install CMake

For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

```bash

sudo apt install cmake

```

### Step 2: Grant premission

To be able to execute the build file you have to grant it execution premission. You can do that with

```bash

chmod +x build.sh

```

### Step 3: build and compile

By simply running the command below you can build and compile the project

```bash

./build.sh

```

This script will:

 - Create the build/ directory if it doesn't exist
 - Run CMake to configure the project
 - Clean previous build files
 - Compile the project
 - Run the visualizer

---

## ü™Ñ Usage

Open main.cpp and choose which sorting algorithm you want to visualize by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding lines:

```cpp

// bubbleSort(window, values); <br>
// quicksort(window, values, 0, values.size() - 1); <br>
mergesort(window, values, 0, values.size() - 1); <br>

```

Then rebuild and run again with

```bash

./build.sh

```
